  <h1>Hypertext markup language</h1>
   Create a paragraph using <p></p>
   Headings go from 1 to 6, in an order from most to least importance
   <h1>Most important</h1><h2></h2><h3></h3><h4></h4><h5></h5><h6>Least important</h6>
   Lists are often used and come in different forms
   <ul> unordered list, no order required
    <li> list item
  <ol> order list
    <li>
  <dl> description list
    <dt> term or name
    <dd> description of term
    <dd> description of term
<!--dl can have more than one dd, but just one dt.
Order matters-->
<q> used to mark up quotes embedded in other elements like a paragraph
  <blockquote> for large stand alone quotes (decorative, larger, pull quote)
  <cite> marking the source of the quote
   <h2>Phrasing elements</h2>
   <em> emphasis 
    <strong> lots of emphasis, importance, urgency
       <i> another language, technical term, title,   visual only italics
       <b> a keyword
    
    <a href=“”> link text </a>
    The opening <a> tells where the link starts and the closing </a> is where the link ends. 
    Use the <a> tag and href for hyperlink 
    
    <img src=“” alt=“” /> 
    Images in websites that are not embedded in the website, but linked to the HTML document.
    Images need two attributes: the location of the image and alternative content.
    Alt- alternative text, description of image
    
<!--Nesting is when something is within another element-->    

<h2>Generic elements</h2>
<!--HTML elements should always be chosen to give meaning to your content, but sometimes we need an element that is meaningless
-->
<div> blocked element used to group elements together

  <span> an inline container used to mark up a part of text, or a part of a document.
  -wrap around text, bole etc
  
  HTML attributes- extra pieces of information in the opening tag to make something work, or give more info to use elsewhere
  <a href=“”> link </a>
  
  <p class=“”>
  You can use a class multiple times throughout your HTML and attach it to different types of elements
  
  <p id="">
  Only allowed to use one unique id once in each HTML page, can only be used once per elements ex: <p id”about me”>
<h2>Structuring content</h2>
<!--Organizing our HTML elements content within typical regions of a web page. 
-->
<header> </header>
Main focus at the top

<footer> </footer>
Extra info at the bottom

<main> </main>
Only used once, wraps around the main content of the page

<section> </section>
Wrapped around related pieces of content, usually has its own heading 

<article> </article> 
Self contained composition of the web page, intended to be independently distributable ex: blog post, widget, product card

<nav> </nav>
Unordered list usually, the nav element represents a section of a page whos purpose is to provide a navigation link, either within the current document or to other documents

Parent-Child nests
<nav> <ul> <li>

<aside> </aside>
This content will frequently be presented as a sidebar in a website. Related sources/info. Indirectly related to the documents main content

<section>
Absolute url: 

<a href=“website address”> This link goes to another url</a>

<img src=“website image address” alt=“description”>

Relative url: 
Relative file path points to a file relative to the current page

<a href=“about.html”> page in same folder as index.html</a>

<img src=“images/images.jpg”alt=“description”/>


</section>

<h2>Web accessibility</h2>
Websites must comply with web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0)

WCAG Principles:
Perceivable
Operable
Understandable
Robust

Perceivable- Content must be presented to user in a way they can discern, regardless of which senses they do or do not have

Operable- Users must be able to find, navigate and interact with web content in multiple ways

Understandable- The content must be understandable to its users

Robust- The site must be developed using well-adopted web standards that will work across all browsers and assistive technologies.
Consistent


Visual impairments
-Allow text to be resized
-Have good contrast in colours
-Test for colour blindness related issues
-Website must work well with screen readers
-Use proper alt attributes


Mobility/dexterity impairments
-Recongnize and prepare for the fact that not everybody will use a mouse
-Make the website keyboard accessible- make sure you are giving users alternate ways to access your information
-Increase hit areas of links and buttons


Auditory impairments
-Provide text captions and subtitles- when including audio or video on your website
-Users may need closed captions while viewing your video in a noisy room or the language you’ve provided may not be their first one


Cognitive impairments
-Make it clear where in the website the user is
-Organize your content correctly
-Make the text easily scannable
-Clearly mark links
-Use plain, simple language


Additional
-Choose HTML tags wisely- semantic HTML, provide extra info that helps people use our website
-Logical order- Keep your code & your content in your HTML documents in the order you expect them to be read
-Headings- Break up your content using headings tags. They’re nice visual breaks, but screen readers use them as jumping points


WAI-ARIA
Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has a specification called Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA)

Landmark roles
ARIA has a set of landmark roles to help those using screen readers to jump directly to specific sections within our sites


<header role=“banner”>
This role is for defining an element as  the masthead, added to the primary <header>
For primary header

<nav role=“navigation”>
This role is for defining an element as the primary navigation, added to the top <nav>
Main nav always in the header that has links to important web pages etc on your site

<main role=“main”>
This role is for defining an element as being the main content of the page, added to the <main>

<aside role=“complimentary”>
This role is for defining an elements as being content related to the primary content, usually added to an <aside>

<footer role=“contentinfo”>
This role is for defining an element as information about the content: ex: copyright, terms, privacy policy, usually added to a <footer>


Labeling links
Adding ARIA label attribute provides the user with a non-visual label that will only be announced by a screen reader

<a href=“#” aria-label=“description of what the user will click through to would go here”> Read more</a>
</article>


Image descriptions
Always describe your images with the alt attribute. If purely decorative you can leave it empty and apply role=“presentation”

<p>The alt attribute has two purposes:
-To describe the photo if it doesn’t download
-To describe the photo to someone who cannot see the image, maybe a screen reader user</p>

Skip links
-Skip links are placed at the top of your page and offer users a way to jump t specific areas of the page

<nav role=“navigation” id=“nav”></nav>
<nav role=“main” id=“main></main>
