<p>You can use nav href "#" to link an element on the same page. <-- --> with ! after the first arrow head to comment. You can use Landmark to help a user navigate the page easier and jump to content. An aria-labelshows what a user will click to. A skip link helps provide a link to a section in your web page. </p> <role="paragraph"></role>

<h1>CSS</h1>

<p>CSS helps make a page look pretty. First you have the HTML, sometimes involving things like text emphasis, but is considered the content core of the page.</p>

<p>Font-family can change things like serifs in text.
  Font-size helps with sizing, rem and points are used.
  Font-weight controls the boldness and stregth.
  Font-style makes text stylized like normal, oblique etc.
  Line-height sets the height of a line box.
  Finally, font shorthand allows you to use font related properties, more than one, in one CSS style rule.
</p>

<p>Text-transform allows you to make changes to the text such as uppercase. Text-decoration adds colours and underlines, things that make the text pretty. Text-align helps move the text to be in line, such as right, left, center. Text-indent adds the indent with values, ex 50px. Finally, text-sahdow adds shadow to text by value and colour ex. 2px red.</p>

<p>There are different states for links on a page, and can be edited by text-decorations too. a:link is normal, a:visited is when you already went there, a:hover is when the cursor is over the link, and a:active is when clicked. This can be useful to the user by showing a difference, what they haven't seen etc. As well as help with accessibility.</p>


<p>You can add certain fonts needed if you embed them in the head of your HTML, Google fonts is useful and can easily be copy and pasted with formatting from the website.</p>

<p>Things like margin and padding help with text content too. Margins help with creating space around elements. While padding is for space around the elements content.
  ex. padding-left: 10px

<h2>Web accessibility</h2>
Websites must comply with web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0)

WCAG Principles:
Perceivable
Operable
Understandable
Robust

Perceivable- Content must be presented to user in a way they can discern, regardless of which senses they do or do not have

Operable- Users must be able to find, navigate and interact with web content in multiple ways

Understandable- The content must be understandable to its users

Robust- The site must be developed using well-adopted web standards that will work across all browsers and assistive technologies.
Consistent


Visual impairments
-Allow text to be resized
-Have good contrast in colours
-Test for colour blindness related issues
-Website must work well with screen readers
-Use proper alt attributes


Mobility/dexterity impairments
-Recongnize and prepare for the fact that not everybody will use a mouse
-Make the website keyboard accessible- make sure you are giving users alternate ways to access your information
-Increase hit areas of links and buttons


Auditory impairments
-Provide text captions and subtitles- when including audio or video on your website
-Users may need closed captions while viewing your video in a noisy room or the language you’ve provided may not be their first one


Cognitive impairments
-Make it clear where in the website the user is
-Organize your content correctly
-Make the text easily scannable
-Clearly mark links
-Use plain, simple language


Additional
-Choose HTML tags wisely- semantic HTML, provide extra info that helps people use our website
-Logical order- Keep your code & your content in your HTML documents in the order you expect them to be read
-Headings- Break up your content using headings tags. They’re nice visual breaks, but screen readers use them as jumping points


WAI-ARIA
Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has a specification called Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA)

Landmark roles
ARIA has a set of landmark roles to help those using screen readers to jump directly to specific sections within our sites


<header role=“banner”>
This role is for defining an element as  the masthead, added to the primary <header>
For primary header

<nav role=“navigation”>
This role is for defining an element as the primary navigation, added to the top <nav>
Main nav always in the header that has links to important web pages etc on your site

<main role=“main”>
This role is for defining an element as being the main content of the page, added to the <main>

<aside role=“complimentary”>
This role is for defining an elements as being content related to the primary content, usually added to an <aside>

<footer role=“contentinfo”>
This role is for defining an element as information about the content: ex: copyright, terms, privacy policy, usually added to a <footer>


Labeling links
Adding ARIA label attribute provides the user with a non-visual label that will only be announced by a screen reader

<a href=“#” aria-label=“description of what the user will click through to would go here”> Read more</a>
</article>


Image descriptions
Always describe your images with the alt attribute. If purely decorative you can leave it empty and apply role=“presentation”

<p>The alt attribute has two purposes:
-To describe the photo if it doesn’t download
-To describe the photo to someone who cannot see the image, maybe a screen reader user</p>

Skip links
-Skip links are placed at the top of your page and offer users a way to jump t specific areas of the page

<nav role=“navigation” id=“nav”></nav>
<nav role=“main” id=“main></main>



<h2>CSS</h2>

Cascading Style Sheets stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of web pages


CSS is the language we use to control the appearance of our HTML pages.
HTML- content
CSS- looks
JAVA- behaviour

A CSS can be created in a code editor and saved with the extension .css.


We need to link the CSS file to the HTML so that the browser knows where to look for the CSS file.
Attach the CSS file within the <head> of the HTML document using the <link> element.

<link rel=“stylesheet” href=“css/style.css”>

The link element is used to attach CSS to the HTML file must have the following two attributes:

HREF- this attribute is used to point to the location of the CSS file must point into the correct folder.
REL- this attribute is used to define this item as a stylesheet

Syntax of CSS- A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block where properties are styled

h1{color:black;}

Rule set- composed of a selector and one or many declarations surrounded by curly braces

Selector: identifies which HTML element should be targeted for styling

Declaration- assigns a value to a property, separated by a colon. Each declaration must end with a semi-colon

Property- the type of design you want to add. Ex. Width, colour, border, etc.

Value- accepted value for property. Ex. 30px, blue, etc.

Targeting HTML-
To style something in CSS you first need to target the element then apply design styles.


Web Design is 95% Typography

-Looser line-height than print. Normal range for web would be between 1.3 - 1.5
-Similar line-length to print. Max 80 characters.
-Lots of breaks: headings, lists, highlights, etc
-Breathing room with whitespace
-Color contrast between text and background

Goes somewhere; link
Does something; button
